            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>1/4 tablespoon chilli flakes</li>
            <li>2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon caster sugar</li>
            <li>6 tablespoon mascarpone</li>
            <li>4 skinless chicken breasts, sliced into strips</li>

            <li>50g grated mozzarella</li>
            <li>1/2 small bunch of parsley, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoon of the oil in a pan over 
                a medium heat and fry the onion gently for 
                10-12 mins. Add the garlic and chilli flakes 
                and cook for 1 min. Tip in the tomatoes and 
                sugar and season to taste. Simmer uncovered for 20 
                mins or until thickened, then stir through the 
                mascarpone
            </li>

            <li>Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a non-stick frying 
                pan. Season the chicken and fry for 5-7 
                mins or until the chicken is cooked through.
            </li>

            <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Cook 
                the penne following pack instructions. 
                Drain and toss with the remaining oil. 
                Tip the pasta into a medium sized ovenproof
                dish. Stir in the chicken and pour over 
                the sauce. Top with the cheddar, 
                mozzarella and parsley. Bake for 20 mins 
                or until golden brown and bubbling.
