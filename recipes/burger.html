      <p>a dish consisting of a flat round cake of minced beef
        , or sometimes another savoury ingredient, that is fried
        or grilled and served in a split bun or roll with 
        various condiments and toppings</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>500g good-quality beef mince</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>All or any of the following to serve:
            sliced tomato, beetroot, horseradish sauce,
            mayonnaise, ketchup, handful iceberg lettuce,
            rocket, watercress</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Tip 500g beef mince into a bowl with 1 
            small diced onion and 1 egg then mix</li><br>

        <li>Divide the mixture into four. Lightly wet your hands.
            Carefully roll the mixture into balls, each about
            the size of a tennis ball</li><br>

        <li>Set in the palm of your hand and gently 
            squeeze down to flatten into patties about 3cm
            thick. Make sure all the burgers are the same
            thickness so that they will cook evenly</li><br>

        <li>Put on a plate, cover with cling film and leave
            in the fridge to firm up for at least 30 minutes</li><br>

        <li>Heat the barbecue to medium hot (there will be 
            white ash over the red hot coals - about 40 minutes
            after lighting). Lightly brush one side of each burger
            with vegetable oil.</li><br>
            
        <li>Place the burgers, oil-side down, on the 
            barbecue. Cook for 5 mins until the meat is 
            slightly charred. Don't move them around or they
            may stick</li><br>

        <li>Oil the other side, then turn over using tongs. 
            Don't press down on the meat, as that will
            squeeze out the juices
        </li>

        <li>Cook for 5 mins more for medium. If you like 
            your burgers pink in the middle, cook 1 min
            less each side. For well done, cook 1 min more
        </li>

        <li>Take the burgers off the barbecue. Leave to 
            rest on a plate so that all the juices can settle
        </li>

        <li>Slice four burger buns in half. Place, cut-side 
            down, on the barbecue rack and toast for 1 min until 
            they are lightly charred. PLace a burger inside each
            bun, then top with your choice of accompaniment
        </li>
        
      </ol>
