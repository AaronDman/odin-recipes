      <p>Piza - a dish made typically of
      flattened bread dough spread with a savory mixture
      usually including tomatoes and cheese and often
      other toppings and baked.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>16 ounces pizza dough</li>
          <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
          <li>18-20 slices pepperoni</li>
          <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano(optional)</li>
          <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
          </ul>

         <ul>
           <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated onion</li>
           <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
         </ul>
         
         <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup softened butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Steps:</h3>
           <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven:
               Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using
                a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for 
                at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot 
                as well.</li>

            <li>Make the sauce:
               If you are using my sauce recipe, 
               stir together the ingredients. The sauce 
               recipe makes just enough for one large pizza.
                You can easily double it if you are making more than
                 one pizza</li>

            <li>Roll out the dough:
               Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface.
                If it's hard to roll, let it rest 
                for 5 minutes so it can come to room 
                temperature. For a large pizza,
                 I like to roll my dough into about a
                  14-inch diameter circle.</li>

            <li>Add the toppings:
               Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted 
               pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a 
               large cast-iron.
               
               Add sauce in a light layer all over the 
               pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around 
               the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and 
               sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza 
               with grated cheese and the rest of the 
               pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</li>

            <li>Cook the pizza:
               If you're using a pizza stone, carefully 
               slide pizza into the center of the preheated
               pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then 
               rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly.
               Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until the 
               crust is golden brown and charred in spots.
               
               If you're using a skillet, press the dough 
               into a cast iron skillet and add toppings. 
               Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 
               2 minutes to get it preheated and get the 
               crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a 
               500 ̊F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or 
               until the crust is golden brown.</li>

            <li>Slice and serve:
               Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a 
               cutting board. Let the pizza rest for a 
               minute and slice into pieces. Season with 
               fresh oregano (optional). Serve while warm 
               with a side salad.</li>

            <li>Make the honey butter (optional):
               Stir together the softened butter and honey,
               then serve alongside the pizza for crust 
               dipping.</li>
           </ol>
